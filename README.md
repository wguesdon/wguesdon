I am a Senior Scientist with experience in immunology, molecular biology and data analysis with R and Python. As a researcher, I have developed strong skills in statistical analysis and communication. My research included analysing complex genomic datasets of immune cell receptors and led to 13 articles in peer-reviewed journals. I have a passion for the use of machine learning in the drug discovery process.
